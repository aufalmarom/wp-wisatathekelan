== Frequently Asked Questions == 
<h4>I can't see the landing page I`ve just activated!</h4>
<p>As long as you're logged in as admin, you cannot see it. That`s the purpose of our plugin -  it displays Maintenance or Landing page only to non-logged or non-admin logged visitors of your page. By this way you can work on your real website and display different page to your visitors. You can preview the page by clicking on "preview" tab, loggout from Wordpress or access your website from different browser.</p>

<h4>503 or 200 HTTP codes, huh?</h4>
<p>OK, it`s easy - if you want to display Coming Soon page you usually wants to search and crawling engines (like Google) to be able to index your website. In that case you need to response with 200 HTTP "OK" - set Coming Soon mode.</p>
<p>On the other hand if you have your website already up and running but you are doing only a short maintenance it`s better to send out response 503 HTTP Service unavailable code. By that way you make sure the search engines do not index your temporarily website while it`s down to maintenance and do not lower your website SEO score.</p>

<h4>Is it a bug? Noone likes BUGS!</h4>
<p>This is awkward and shame on us:(. Fortunately we are nice guys and if you let us know about it trough <a href="https://niteothemes.com">NiteoThemes website</a> contact form we promise to fix it as soon as possible!</p>
